# Corey and Devin's Wedding Website

This is a website I created to help display information about the wedding and provide easy registry access.

**Live site [here](http://www.coreyanddevin.com).**

## Installation

npm install

## Usage

Run default with `grunt`

`sass` is used to compile the sass file into css.
The new file is created with the extension `.css`

`watch` to notice a change in the sass file and then executes the `sass` command automatically compiling the file without calling the command yourself.
